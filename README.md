ABSTRACT
This project aims to develop a solution that facilitates the identification of the best
products on online shopping websites based on their price, customer reviews, and
ratings. By leveraging data analytics and visualization techniques, the system
empowers users to make informed decisions when purchasing products from various
online platforms. The key focus is to present the information in an easy-to-understand
manner through chart representations.
 The user-friendly interface allows users to input their preferences, such as product
category, price range, and desired ratings. The system then filters the vast product
database to present tailored recommendations. The chart representations enable users
to observe trends, identify outliers, and make well-informed choices based on their
individual needs and budget constraints.
 Moreover, the project also evaluates and ranks online shopping websites based on
the overall quality of their products and services. By considering factors like product
availability, pricing, customer satisfaction, and shipping efficiency, users can gauge
which websites stand out as preferable options compared to others.
 This project offers a valuable tool to assist online shoppers in finding the best
products across various e-commerce platforms. The data-driven approach ensures
transparency and enables users to make purchases with confidence, ultimately
enhancing their online shopping experience.
